# GMX NNPot Wrapper

This repository contains a collection of example wrappers around popular Neural Network potentials for use with the NNPot interface in GROMACS. We also provide an example notebook to export the models, as well as an example use case for a simulation of Alanine Dipeptide solvated in water. To try these examples out for yourself, clone this repository, create the conda environment specified in `environment.yaml` and go through the example notebook.
